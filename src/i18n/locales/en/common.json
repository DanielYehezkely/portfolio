    "aboutBody": "I started coding at the end of 2023 and fell for the rhythm of building: small ideas, quick iterations, sharper results. Then life called—reserve duty—twice. Each pause pulled me from the keyboard, but not from the craft. I kept notes, read docs on my phone, and sketched features I’d ship 'when I’m back.' I finished a front-end course in between, served again until August 2025, and returned with more grit than before. Now I’m back — ready to learn fast, ship clean, and turn ideas into real products."
